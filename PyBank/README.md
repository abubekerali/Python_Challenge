## Unit 3 | Assignment - financial data

## Option 1: PyBank


In this challenge, the task was creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of banking company. Two sets of revenue data (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`) was given. Each dataset composed of two columns: `Date` and `Revenue`. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

the analysis result look was the one below:

```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total Revenue: $1241412
Average Revenue Change: $216825
Greatest Increase in Revenue: Sep-16 ($815531)
Greatest Decrease in Revenue: Aug-12 ($-652794)
```

the final script was able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future . In addition, the final script s both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
